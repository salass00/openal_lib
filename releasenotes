1.18.2-20180222 (22.2.2018)

- First released version


1.18.2r2 (5.4.2018)

- Replaced almtx_*, alcnd_* and altss_* functions with code not using
  pthreads.

- Changed ALCplaybackAHI_stop() to periodically check if the mixer process has
  ended rather than relying on the death signal. This fixes uqm hanging on
  exit when used with openal because ALCplaybackAHI_start() was called from
  a different process.
